# Scraps

Scrap.TF Raffle Joiner

![In Action](https://i.imgur.com/3gugL2I.png)

The idea Scraps was conceived during one of my periods of "devious programming".

It uses no exploits, all operations use the website's AJAX endpoints to handle loading of raffles and joining them. The timings are tuned for high efficiency as to avoid hitting rate limits and errors.

## Usage

### Conventional usage

Simply double-click the Scraps.exe file. The first time it is ran, you will be prompted to enter your `scr_session` cookie value that is stored in your browser while you are logged in to the website. You can paste values into the console window by right-clicking the output area or by right-clicking the window's titlebar, going to Edit, and clicking Paste.

For more info, please consult the [instructions.](https://github.com/depthbomb/Scraps/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md)

### Command line usage

There are a few options that can be passed to Scraps when you run it

* `--verbose`/`-v` - Log debug info to the console window, not really any use to the normal user unless you just want to see more of what's going on
* `--config`/`-c` - Opens your settings file in your OS's default program and closes Scraps
