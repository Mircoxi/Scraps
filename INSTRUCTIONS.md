## Before you start

In order for Scraps to work, it needs your Scrap.TF cookie. Scraps will then use this cookie to "log in" as you so it may enter raffles on your behalf.

1. Visit Scrap.TF in a browser where you are logged into the site
2. Go to your browser's developer tools, click Application at the top, and open up the Cookies menu on the side [(Image)](https://i.imgur.com/mJ3hfnr.png)
3. Copy the entire value for the cookie named `scr_session` and paste it your `Settings.xml` file.
4. Scraps will remain logged in as you so long as you do not log out of Scrap.TF

If you need to give Scraps a new cookie value, you can

- Run Scraps with the `--config` flag to open your settings file so you may change the cookie
- Delete your `Settings.xml` file and restart the program
  - This will reset _all_ of your settings in the process

## Updating Scraps
To update the program, simply download the latest release, run the extractor and overwrite all of the files in your existing Scraps installation. Your settings will remain unchanged as they are stored elsewhere.
